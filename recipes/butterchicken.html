    <h1>Butter Chicken</h1>

    <h3 id='image label'>A collection of recipes from delish web!</h3>
    <p>Aside from a name that's a hoot to utter, Chicken Riggies (aka Utica, New York’s pasta
        <br> pride and joy) has a lot more going for it, namely that it's a spicy and a bit-sweet
        <br> pleasure to eat. It’s so good,
        <br> it might just become a new go-to weeknight dinner for all you non-Uticans out there.
