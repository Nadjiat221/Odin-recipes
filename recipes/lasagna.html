    <p>Aside from a name that's a hoot to utter, Chicken Riggies (aka Utica, New York’s pasta
       <br> pride and joy) has a lot more going for it, namely that it's a spicy and a bit-sweet
       <br> pleasure to eat. It’s so good,
       <br> it might just become a new go-to weeknight dinner for all you non-Uticans out there.

    <h4>Recipe instructions (taken from the book)</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons of salt.
             Add pasta and cook until just al dente, between 5-7 minutes. Drain, 
             but reserve about 1 cup of the pasta water. 
             Set aside pasta and reserved pasta water.
        </li>
        <li>In a large heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat,
             add the oil and heat until shimmering. Working in batches, 
             add chicken in 1 layer and cook until browned on all sides,
              about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer chicken to a plate.</li>

         <li>Pour in the white wine, and deglaze the pan by scraping up any browned bits.
             Allow to cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Add tomato puree, and stir
             until everything is combined. Bring to a boil, lower heat, and simmer for about 7 minutes.</li> 
             
        <li>Serve in bowls, and garnish with more cheese and basil.</li>
    </ol>
